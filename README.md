# Banking System Application

This is a simple **console-based Banking System** developed using **Java.** The project is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as **encapsulation** (data hiding using private fields and public getters/setters), **inheritance** (Savings and Current Accounts extending a common Account class), **abstraction** (interfaces and abstract class usage to hide implementation details), and **polymorphism** (method overriding and runtime Polymorphism).
